## Project Overview

**STRIKE** is an interactive, visually immersive web platform designed to simulate a futuristic tech bootcamp experience. The project combines modern UI design, animations, and structured content to create an engaging environment for learners aiming to master advanced programming, DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms), and AI technologies.

The website is a static frontend project but demonstrates a strong focus on user experience with dynamic animations, glassmorphic design elements, and responsive layouts.
